# About me
My name is Anton, I love programming and GameDev in particular. I'm learning Unity C# on my own and aiming for perfect code ;)

In active development i have 2 projects: [Remagures](https://github.com/Atennop1/Remagures)(game that I will release to the store) and [Swamp Attack clone](https://github.com/Atennop1/Swamp-Attack)(game to hone my skills)

Co-author of the game "[Gift or Coal](https://github.com/Funny-Monkeys/Gift-or-Coal)", made at the New Year's game jam

On December 31, 2022, I saw a meme associated with a minesweeper and already on January 5, 2023, the first version of [my minesweeper](https://github.com/Atennop1/Minesweeper) was ready :p

I have a [repository](https://github.com/Atennop1/Learning-Stuff) where I learn something new.
